// These mutuations allow us to update the user resource for a given user. Currently we are only creating and destroying, but based on the assigned feature we will have to be able to update as well.

// The attributes (args) that a user will be able to update are shipping address and email address.

// In order for update to function, we will need to create an update action in the resolvers file
